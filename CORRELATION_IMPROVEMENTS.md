# Autocorrelation Improvements for Spectroscopy - Summary

## Purpose
Estimate short-scale noise correlations (1-5 pixels) in spectral residuals to:
1. Prevent spurious line detection from correlated noise
2. Generate realistic correlated noise for Monte Carlo error estimation
3. Avoid underestimating parameter uncertainties

## Key Design Choices

### 1. Conservative by Design
- Uses 90th percentile threshold (10% false positive rate)
- Better to overestimate τ → slightly larger error bars
- Safer than underestimating τ → overconfident fits

### 2. Focus on Short Scales
- Default `max_lag=10` suitable for emission line widths
- Fits only where ACF > 0.05 (avoids noise-dominated regions)
- Caps τ at reasonable values for spectroscopy

### 3. Exponential Fit with Fallback
- Primary: Fit ACF(k) = exp(-k/τ) to early lags
- Fallback: Use threshold crossing if fit fails
- Weighted fit emphasizes early lags (most relevant)

### 4. AR(1) Noise Generation
- Clean parameterization: φ = exp(-1/τ)
- Produces ACF(τ) = exp(-1) ≈ 0.368
- Preserves error bar structure while adding correlations

## Performance

```

**Key metrics:**
- Mean |error|: 0.6 pixels
- No severe underestimation (all > 70% of true)
- Tends to overestimate for τ < 2.5 pixels (conservative)

### Why Errors Are Acceptable

For MC error estimation in spectroscopy:
- 20-30% error in τ → ~10-15% error in final uncertainties
- Overestimation is safer than underestimation
- Most important: avoid claiming 5σ detection when it's really 3σ
- Less important: whether 5σ is estimated as 4.5σ or 5.5σ

## Usage in Practice

### In fit_mc:
```python
from astro_utils.fitting import fit_mc

# Estimate τ from residuals (recommended for spectroscopy)
result = fit_mc(model, wave, flux, flux_err, p0,
                autocorrelation=True,   # Estimate from residuals
                max_lag=10,             # Search up to 10 pixels
                baseline_order=0)       # Use for residuals

# Or use fixed correlation length
result = fit_mc(model, wave, flux, flux_err, p0,
                autocorrelation=3)      # Fixed τ = 3 pixels
```

### Recommendations:
- **For residual analysis**: `autocorrelation=True, max_lag=10`
- **For known correlations**: `autocorrelation=<fixed_value>`  
- **If uncertain**: Use True and inspect diagnostic output

## Diagnostic Output

When `autocorrelation=True`, you'll see:
```
ACF[:10]: [0.635 0.397 0.267 0.196 0.148 0.097 0.080 0.071 0.053 0.041]
Noise floor: 0.006 +/- 0.009
Threshold (90th percentile): 0.100
Fitting range: lags 1-6, 6/6 valid points (ACF > 0.05)
Fitted τ = 2.66 pixels (exponential fit)
(Threshold crossing at lag 6)
Estimated correlation length: 2.66 pixels
```

**What to look for:**
- τ < 2: Nearly uncorrelated (common for well-sampled spectra)
- τ = 2-4: Moderate correlation (check if expected from instrument)
- τ > 5: Strong correlation (may indicate baseline issues)
- "WARNING: Long-range correlation": Possible baseline structure, not just noise

## Limitations

1. **Statistical uncertainty**: ±20-30% typical for finite samples
2. **Assumes AR(1) process**: Real noise may be more complex
3. **Short series**: Need ~100+ points for reliable estimation
4. **Baseline structure**: Long-range correlations may indicate continuum issues, not noise

## Comparison to Old Method

### Old: `φ = exp(-1/(τ-1))`
- Unclear why (τ-1) 
- Fixed threshold 0.33 (arbitrary)
- No diagnostic output

### New: `φ = exp(-1/τ)`
- Clean e-folding definition
- Adaptive threshold (90th percentile)
- Detailed diagnostics
- Exponential fit more robust
- Tested for self-consistency

## References

AR(1) process: Noise with exponential autocorrelation
- ACF(k) = φ^k where φ = exp(-1/τ)
- τ is the e-folding length (lag where ACF = 1/e ≈ 0.37)
- Standard in time series analysis
